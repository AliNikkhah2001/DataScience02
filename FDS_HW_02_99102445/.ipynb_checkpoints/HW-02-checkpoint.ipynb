During the lectures, you have seen (or soon will see) how maximizing user engagement and click-rate is of great importance and a main objective for such businesses.  \n",

    "### Understanding the Problem\n",
    "As stated above, Upworthy is, in essence, a content creation and news delivery business. The process of creating a news-related post starts from the raw material and then proceeds to processing the information and presenting it in a way that engages the users, i.e. having them interact with the website, as much as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed main objectives and income sources of various businesses and how data science can affect that. You must know that the main source of revenue and consequently the most important goal of Upworthy, is to get the most views and clicks per piece of news.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical form of presentation for news websites is to first show the user a headline together with a thumbnail and sometimes an excerpt (or **lede** as defined later). But it is a well-known fact that not all the headlines attract users the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are always several possible headlines that can be used for a piece of news. Nonetheless, just one can be used for presenting each content and we know that there is no scientific or formulaic approach to predict which one will actually be the most interesting for the users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is where you data scientists are brought into field!**  \n",
    "The problem is simply to find which headline should be chosen for any individual post to maximize the website's profit. What solutions come to your mind? Can you think of a novel formula to mathematically calculate an indicator of the headlines attractiveness? What about its engaging rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discuss\n",
    "What possible solutions can you think of for this problem? Can you solve it mathematically? If so explain your solution, and if not, explain why do you think it's not feasible?"

    "A/B tests are experiments that compare two scenarios (e.g., scenario A vs. scenario B). \n",
    "They test subjects' responses to each of the variants to determine which is more effective ([read more about A/B tests on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)).  \n",
    "A/B tests allow us to draw conclusions about the different scenarios by randomizing exposure to them, e.g., one could flip a coin and assign a user to scenario A if it lands heads and to B if it lands tails.  \n",
    "Since exposure is randomized, we can be confident that the scenarios are the sole explanation for statistically significant differences in subjects' responses (if they exist).  \n",
    "In theory, A/B testing refers to an experiment that compares two scenarios; however, in practice, the term is also used when we compare multiple scenarios (e.g., A vs. B vs. C), although the more precise terminology would be to call such an experiment a \"multinomial test.\""
